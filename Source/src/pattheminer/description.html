<h2>A benchmark for Pat The Miner</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/liflab/PatTheMiner">Pat The Miner</a> is an extension
to the <a href="https://liflab.github.io/beepbeep-3">BeepBeep</a> event stream engine.
It provides various functions and processors to perform two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>Compute in real time whether a stream of events deviates from 
a reference "trend"</li>
<li>Compute referece trends from an event stream or a collection of reference
event streams</li>
</ol>

<p>This benchmark measures the performance of these two functionalities, using
various types of input event streams, pattern computations, and distance metrics.</p>

<p>The results in this benchmark are mentioned in the following publication(s):</p>
